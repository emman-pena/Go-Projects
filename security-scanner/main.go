/**
The purpose of this program is to create a basic security scanner that scans
a network or system to identify potential vulnerabilities. Specifically, it:

Identifies Open Ports:
Scans a range of ports (1â€“1024 by default) to find which ones are open and
listening. Open ports can expose services running on a system, which might be
vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.

Checks for Misconfigurations:
Includes checks for specific vulnerabilities, such as services like MongoDB
being accessible without authentication. This highlights weak security
configurations that need to be addressed.

Serves as a Security Tool:
Helps administrators or security professionals understand the exposed attack
surface of their infrastructure.
Provides an initial step in securing systems by identifying open doors (ports)
and common vulnerabilities.

Inputs:

protocol: The type of connection (e.g., tcp).

Functionality:

Creates an address string in the form of hostname:port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:80).
Attempts to connect to the address using net.DialTimeout. If successful,
it means the port is open.
Returns true if the connection succeeds, otherwise false.

Purpose: Speeds up scanning by using Goroutines for concurrency.

Concurrency Control:

sem is a buffered channel with a size of 10 to limit the number of
simultaneous Goroutines.
A Goroutine is spawned for each port being scanned.
Each Goroutine runs independently, checking its assigned port.
Flow:

Push a token (true) into the channel before starting a Goroutine.
After scanning, the Goroutine removes a token (<-sem) to free up space in
the channel.
Limits concurrency to 10 Goroutines at a time.
