/**
A proxy is an intermediary that acts on behalf of a client or server, relaying requests
and responses between them. It serves as a middle layer between the client
(such as a web browser) and the server (such as a web application).

Forward Proxy:

Used by clients to access servers.
The client sends requests to the proxy, which forwards them to the target server.
Common use cases:
Hiding the clientâ€™s identity (IP address).
Bypassing restrictions or filters (e.g., accessing blocked websites).
Caching responses to reduce server load.
Example: A corporate network proxy that filters web traffic.

Reverse Proxy:

Used by servers to manage client requests.
Clients send requests to the reverse proxy, which forwards them to the
appropriate backend server.
Common use cases:
Load balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers.
Caching: Storing static resources to reduce load on the server.
Security: Hiding server details from clients and preventing direct access.
SSL/TLS termination: Managing encryption for secure connections.

Key Features of a Proxy
Anonymity: Proxies can hide the client's or server's IP address.
Performance: Proxies can cache data to reduce the need for repeated
requests to the same server.
Security: Proxies can filter malicious requests or prevent unauthorized access.
Load Distribution: Reverse proxies can distribute client requests to multiple
servers, improving scalability.
